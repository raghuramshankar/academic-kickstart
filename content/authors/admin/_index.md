I am an M.Sc. Student in the Programme Electric Power Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. I am currently a part of Chalmers Formula Student, where we are building an electric formula-style car to compete in International Formula Student competition. I am responsible for Vehicle Controls and Torque Vectoring.

I have formerly had one year of research experience during my Bachelor's and have presented one research paper on Multilevel Inverters.
I am interested in Lithium-ion Battery Systems, Controls and Power Electronic Converters.
